# FuTRES Website Source Files

This repository contains the source files for generating the [FuTRES website](http://futres.org/).
To make changes to the FuTRES website, simply edit the files in the ```content``` directory corresponding
to each section (e.g. about.md, team.md, etc...).  All content is written in Markdown, and you should 
be able to get a reasonable fascimile of your changes as you edit in github by using the "preview" button.  

When you are done making changes, you will need to wait 10-30 minutes for netlify and github to work things out for you to view changes at the [FuTRES website](http://futres.org/).

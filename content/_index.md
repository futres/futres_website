description: FuTRES (Functional Trait Resource for Environmental Studies) is a workflow for assembling functional trait data measured at the specimen level, and a database to serve that data. It is based on a semantic model and is powered by extensible parsers, a backend database, and an API. A key aspect of FuTRES is the ability to collect, store, aggregate, and share data at the individual or specimen and higher levels without loss of information.

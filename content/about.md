<p>The purpose of FuTRES is to make trait data from biological and paleontological specimens accessible in a format that improves discoverability. By following a few steps and using new tools developed by the FuTRES team, these data can be shared on the FuTRES platform, which is backed by an ontological framework that enables logical reasoning.</p>

## Template ##
<p>We have developed a template (<a href="https://github.com/futres/template">viewable here</a>) to help data providers create datasets that are ready for ingestion into the FuTRES knowledge base. The field names in the template largely correspond to <a href="https://dwc.tdwg.org/">Darwin Core</a> terms. Since Darwin Core is the most commonly used standard for sharing biodiversity occurrence data, these fields may already be pre-existing in most collections databases, or if not, they can be easily mapped or crosswalked from other existing fields.</p>

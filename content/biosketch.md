   <td colspan="2" width="70%">I am a paleobiologist interested in paleoclimatic and paleovegetation reconstructions using small vertebrates, mainly amphibians and reptiles because they are dependent on temperature and humidity. I use species distribution and their climatic niche, and I want to use the species abundance - niche centroid distance relationship to paleoclimatic reconstructions. I'm very interested in using the morphology to predict the habitat type of fossil organisms, and relate the vertebrates response to vegetation structure and climate change.
<p>
I'm looking forward to learn new methods and contribute with ideas in the functional traits analyses, and drive the knowledge to Mexican paleontology. This will be my first time in Eugene and am so excited to participate in the workshop with all of you.

My research is based in both Africa and North America and my questions primarily focus on mammals and their associated environments. I use multiple proxies to ask paleoecological questions including stable isotopes from bioapatite, collagen, and soil carbonates,  fossil morphology, occurrence, taxonomy, and satellite-based climate and vegetation data. Much of this data is associated with hominin and archeological data.
<p>
I am excited to see how others organize and use their trait-based data to answer ecological questions. I also love the West Coast (I’m from Arizona) and I’m looking forward to seeing the stark landscapes of the Oregon coast.

I use empirical (molecular + phenotypic) datasets plus biodiversity informatics tools to understand evolution of mammalian phenotypes, life histories, and ecological traits in explicit phylogenetic and spatial contexts. 
<p>
Most of my datasets are taxon-centric (North American rodents) and maximize either shape resolution (3D GM of skeletal + genital elements) and spatiotemporal coverage (body lengths/masses in small mammals). 
<p>
I’m looking forward to developing ideas about how to expand these types of datasets in space and time, and especially across Rodentia. And I love the west coast so can’t wait for Eugene!

   <td colspan="2" width="70%">I am a mammalogist and ecologist interested in patterns and drivers of diversity.  I recently defended my PhD at the University of New Hampshire and will be starting as a postdoc at Ohio State with Marta Jarzyna this fall. My dissertation research focused on using functional diversity to investigate the drivers of community assembly, elevational diversity gradients, and change over the last century in small mammal communities in the Great Basin of western North America. As part of this work I used museum specimens to identify several continuous morphological/phenotypic traits that offer higher-resolution data on species differences compared to categorical guild assignments, including kidney morphology, hair density, and craniodental morphology. I am interested in learning about tools for applying functional diversity to broader spatial and temporal scales as well as digging deeper into intraspecific variation in key traits across species’ ranges and how it may influence analyses of functional biogeography.

Unfortunately I can’t be in Eugene for the workshop, but I am excited to be joining in as much as possible remotely!

In this capacity, I co-developed the low magnification stereomicrowear technique with Nikos Solounias from NYIT —a novel method of examining microscopic scars on dental enamel caused by food substances which employs a standard light stereoscope to examine tooth enamel surfaces.  I have also focused on improving the resolution and repeatability of gross tooth wear methodologies (i.e., mesowear analyses) by co-developing "the mesowear ruler" with Matthew Mihlbachler and Nikos Solounias from NYIT (Old Wesbury, NY USA) and Florent Rivals (Institut Català de Paleoecologia Humana i Evolució Social -IPHES - in Tarragona, Spain). Consequently, most of my data is enamel microwear and mesowear data of living and fossil ungulates and primates.

I began with application of linear morphometrics on mammals for various type of taxonomic and systematic needs for biodiversity analyses. I then grew to enjoy the application of multivariate approaches to address questions dealing with ontogenetic variation, species delimitations, and correlating morphology with environmental variables. In my lab we have been working with traditional linear morphometrics and 2D geometric morphometrics. I began working on Matlab and then made a transition to R and love learning new applications and potentially developing new approaches to morphology as it applies to taxonomy, functional ecology and diversity, biogeography, population variation, and evolutionary biology. I would love to learn more about 3D geometric morphometrics and techniques for modularity type questions.

   <td colspan="2" width="70%">Hi everyone! I'm an environmental archaeologist with a specialty in zooarchaeology. I love tromping around in the forests and mountains of Central America digging up data on the ancient relationship between people, animals, and environments.  
<p>
Together with a super team of fun folks, Rob Guralnick and I have been developing <a href="https://zooarchnet.org/">ZooArchNet</a>, a platform designed to mobilize Darwin-core enabled zooarchaeological data into the biodiversity network while linking it to open archaeological data publishers. These "early anthropocene" specimen data allow us to bridge the gap between paleontology and neontology, providing pre-human baselines and lessons about human environmental decision-making. 
<p>
Sharing specimen data means sharing attribute data - so the collaborative research potential of FuTRES is super exciting and I'm looking forward to lots of brainstorming with all the participants in Oregon.

   <td colspan="2" width="70%">I am a PhD student at the University of Florida in biodiversity informatics. I am a Research Assistant on the FuTRES project, applying my knowledge about natural history specimen data standards and ontologies to the use cases.
<p>
I am looking forward to the Pacific Northwest weather, especially since Gainesville, Florida weather is terrible in July. I would like to get in some hikes and see some giant trees.

   <td colspan="2" width="70%">I am currently a postdoctoral research associate working with the <a href="https://futres.org/">FuTRES</a> (Functional Trait Resource for Environmental Studies) team to develop a way to search and aggregate specimen-level trait data. 
<p>
My expertise are in vertebrate traits. Through this workshop, I hope to see what the needs of the community are, and how to better ingest data. I enjoy the outdoors and so hope to get a hike (or two) in while I’m in OR.

   <td colspan="2" width="70%">My research focuses on ontology-based data integration, ontology design, and identifier services for large and dispersed datasets. Although my background (and first love) is in the ecology and evolution of plants, my work is not restricted to plant science and includes many domains. I am an active member of the biodiversity standards community, including TDWG (Biodiversity Information Standards), GSC (Genomics Standards Consortium), and the OBO Foundry. As the senior science informatician at CyVerse, I am primarily responsible for organizing things, so I work on initiatives related to data management and integration, metadata use and harmonization, and incorporating ontologies into CyVerse cyberinfrastructure. 
<p>
I am looking forward to spending a week in a place it is under 100 degrees.

   <td colspan="2" width="70%">I am an evolutionary biologist/vertebrate paleontologist that works mostly in the Neogene and Quaternary of Eurasia and Africa.  I am concerned with large mammals, but within this group I work on  fossil and recent Equidae.  I frame large mammal evolution within a chronologic and biogeographic framework to understand the relationships between tectonics, climate change, environmental response, mammalian evolution and biogeographic distribution patterns.  The image to the right includes a small part of the extant zebras in the National Museum of Kenya, Nairobi that I am studying along with their Pleistocene representatives
<p>
I'm looking forward to learn new methods and contribute with ideas in the functional traits analyses, and better implement my knowledge of Neogene paleontology. This will be my first time in Eugene and I am enthusiastic about  participating in the workshop with all of you.

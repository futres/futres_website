I am a paleobiologist interested in the evolution of terrestrial vertebrate communities, the biogeography and evolution of large mammals, and the impact of humans on ecosystems at the dawn of the anthropocene. I also use functional traits such as body mass and hypsodonty to answer questions about the relationship between environmental change and community turnover. 
  <p>
I am currently investigating changes in large mammal occurrences in the Indian Subcontinent over the last 4 million years, and look forward to learning about ways to standardize my data, and share ecomorphological data that I have collected over the years.

I am a third year PhD student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  I am a paleoecologist interested in the evolutionary history of mammal communities and the way they assemble through time.  My research aims to disentangle biotic and abiotic factors that significantly impact community structure prior to and during the presence of hominids using a macroecological approach.  Currently, I am looking at the functional diversity of Cenozoic mammal communities in North America.
  <p>
I am excited to learn about new analytical tools and the most effective ways to use species traits to track ecological change.

I am a paleoecologist focused on how ecological change has affected the course of human evolution as well as how humans have affected their environments. My research is based in both Africa and North America and my questions primarily focus on mammals and their associated environments. I use multiple proxies to ask paleoecological questions including stable isotopes from bioapatite, collagen, and soil carbonates,  fossil morphology, occurrence, taxonomy, and satellite-based climate and vegetation data. Much of this data is associated with hominin and archeological data.

I’m a PhD candidate in the Department of Anthropology at UF. Archaeology and natural history museum collections are invaluable to my research, which draws on human behavioral ecology, biodiversity studies, and zooarchaeological analysis to examine how people in the Caribbean interacted with animals and their environments during pre-Contact periods.
  <p>
During my studies I’ve learned that zooarchaeologists are important contributors to trait-based datasets! Some of my relevant work includes describing extinct rodent species known only from Grenadian archaeological contexts and working with collaborators to investigate how past ritual activities impacted the biogeography of Caribbean rock iguana by comparing biomarkers of specimens from archaeological and neontological collections. 
  <p>
I’m looking forward to learning how FuTRES can help increase access to datasets across disciplines for more informed and collaborative research.

I am a mammalogist and ecologist interested in patterns and drivers of diversity.  I am particularly interested in using functional diversity to investigate the drivers of community assembly, elevational diversity gradients, and biodiversity change. As part of this work I use museum specimens to collect morphological, phenotypic, and life history trait data that offer higher-resolution data on species differences compared to categorical guild assignments, including kidney morphology, hair density, and craniodental morphology. I am interested in learning about tools for applying functional diversity to broad spatial and temporal scales as well as exploring intraspecific variation in key traits across species’ ranges and how it may influence analyses of functional biogeography.

I am an integrative biologist interested in landscape- to continental-scale patterns of mammalian evolution and responses of mammals to past and present environmental change. I use empirical (molecular, phenotypic, trait-based) datasets as well as informatics tools to understand the ecological and environmental contexts in which mammalian phenotypes, life histories, and ecological traits evolve. 
  <p>
Most of my trait datasets are taxon-centric (North American rodents) and consist of morphological or reproductive metrics. Some of these maximize shape resolution (3D GM of skeletal + genital elements) while other maximize spatiotemporal coverage (body lengths/masses in small mammals).

I am a paleoecologist interested in understanding the processes that govern mammalian diet and community structure change through time. Some of my work focuses on extant mammals where I use phylogenetic comparative methods to understand mammalian diet evolution, diversity, and how these relate to body mass. For my work on fossil assemblages, I use tooth morphology, and stable isotopic studies, to test hypotheses about the ecological links among extinct taxa and their environment. To better understand how past climate change has influenced structural change, I combine my research to reconstruct food webs for fossil assemblages. I hope that by using the fossil record to explore past ecological structure, my research not only helps expand our paleontological knowledge but also informs how modern communities might respond to current human-influenced climate change and extinction.
  <p>
I am excited to talk to others about trait data standardization to allow for reproducibility and collaboration. I have lots of tooth measurements for both modern and extinct mammals from collections around the USA.

I am a paleoecologist and focus on using dental tooth wear as a mechanism for assessing dietary traits in herbivorous ungulates and other mammals in order to study global trends in vegetation and climate and extinction patterns through significant climatic events and over vast periods of time. In this capacity, I co-developed the low magnification stereomicrowear technique with Nikos Solounias from NYIT —a novel method of examining microscopic scars on dental enamel caused by food substances which employs a standard light stereoscope to examine tooth enamel surfaces.  I have also focused on improving the resolution and repeatability of gross tooth wear methodologies (i.e., mesowear analyses) by co-developing "the mesowear ruler" with Matthew Mihlbachler and Nikos Solounias from NYIT (Old Wesbury, NY USA) and Florent Rivals (Institut Català de Paleoecologia Humana i Evolució Social -IPHES - in Tarragona, Spain). Consequently, most of my data is enamel microwear and mesowear data of living and fossil ungulates and primates.

I am a doctoral student in the Department of Anthropology focusing on zooarchaeology. For the past several years my assistantship has been to oversee the comparative skeletal collection. There are over 11,000 vertebrate (mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and birds) and 1,200 invertebrate specimens (predominantly freshwater mussels from the SE U.S.) accessioned into the collection. Currently, the lab focus is to transition the collection to be available online as there are associated metric data and living histories collected for each specimen which would be valuable across scientific disciplines. 
  <p>
My archaeological research interests include how and why people move across landscapes, what role subsistence plays in site choice, impacts on faunal communities from seasonal and climatic environmental changes, and exploring their resiliency to change. My dissertation research is focused on faunal assemblages from the last ~4,000-2,500 years within the Florida Everglades, a dynamic freshwater wetlands ecosystem.

I study the evolution and ecology of mammals using the fossil record. Much of my work is on rodents, particularly pocket gophers and their relatives, but I also study whole assemblages. I use morphological data (especially craniodental morphology) to reconstruct the evolution of ecology on trees. I also use quantitative analyses of abundance data to explore the response of small mammals to immigrations and changes in climate or environment.

I would say I am a classically trained mammalogist. I’m currently an assistant professor at Chicago State University and a research associate at The Field Museum. I began with application of linear morphometrics on mammals for various type of taxonomic and systematic needs for biodiversity analyses. I then grew to enjoy the application of multivariate approaches to address questions dealing with ontogenetic variation, species delimitations, and correlating morphology with environmental variables. In my lab we have been working with traditional linear morphometrics and 2D geometric morphometrics. I began working on Matlab and then made a transition to R and love learning new applications and potentially developing new approaches to morphology as it applies to taxonomy, functional ecology and diversity, biogeography, population variation, and evolutionary biology. I would love to learn more about 3D geometric morphometrics and techniques for modularity type questions. I would be very interested in learning about any newer multivariate approaches and big data management. I am looking forward to a collaborative atmosphere with like-minded people.

I am a new NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology at Texas A&M and the School of Biological Sciences at Georgia Tech. I recently received my PhD in Ecosystem Science and Management at Texas A&M. I use trait-based approaches for understanding community-level faunal responses to environmental change. Much of my work focuses on using trait-environment relationships in ungulate communities, including hypsodonty and limb metrics. I am interested in how ecological and evolutionary processes drive community assemblage patterns and what we can learn from traits in the fossil record to inform modern conservation and management.

I’m a zooarachaeologist from Chile with many many interests. As a researcher I still haven’t done any significant contribution since I’ve just obtained my Masters degree in Archaeology at the University of Chile (Universidad de Chile) where I explored multivariate statistics to assess taphonomic bias in archaeological sites. One of my main interests is the development of methods to aid in identification of skeletal remains and to try and integrate taphonomical information into zooarchaeological data in a more compelling way.
  <p>
I’m a beginner in R and willing to try and gather as many skills as possible in statistical analysis for archaeological or paleozoological inquiry, personally I’m quite interested in learning FuTRES ontologies to integrate them into my projects to come and to share the quite large archaeological and modern osteological sample datasets i’ve recorded throughout my study years, these include morphometric measurements of avian and mammal remains ranging from 5000 cal B.P. to sub actual samples, among other information. I also contribute as a researcher in the ONG Carnivoros Australes, where we plan to use zooarchaeological methods to aid in conservation efforts.

My research focuses on the interaction of climatic, vegetation, and faunal changes in the fossil record, particularly with respect to ape and hominin paleoecologies.  I use stable isotopic and dental microwear analyses to reconstruct paleohabitats, climates, and diets. To better reconstruct the past, I also work with modern ecosystems.  My goal is to have a direct comparison between fossil and modern data to better interpret fossil ape and hominin adaptations.  Much of my work focuses on Miocene hominoids and modern chimpanzees. 
  <p>
In addition to isotopic analyses, I maintain a skeletal collection of fauna, including chimpanzees, collected opportunistically at Kibale National Park, Uganda, and I am interested in digitizing specimens to make the collections accessible worldwide.

Hello! I’m looking forward to learning a lot from everyone at the workshop. I’m interested in paleontology, evolution, ontogeny, paleoecology, functional morphology, and morphometrics. Lately, I’ve been most interested in the role of developmental plasticity, and behavior during life, in shaping functional traits. My research has focused on the morphology, taxonomy, paleoecology, and evolution of Old World monkeys, especially from the Plio-Pleistocene of eastern Africa.

I’m a zooarchaeologist specializing in stable isotope analysis of faunal remains, but one of my pet peeves is when people do not record detailed information about specimens before sampling for biomolecular/geochemical analyses (or bother to consider the zooarchaeological context!) I also think zooarchaeologists and paleontologists should talk to each other more...
  <p>
I’ve been involved in developing a zooarchaeological stable isotope database with Neotoma over the past few years, and part of that has necessitated the ability to input associated specimen-level data (such as element, side, etc) which was not previously possible.
  <p>
Most of my work has focused on human-animal-environment interaction in the eastern Mediterranean/Aegean/Adriatic, on islands, from the late glacial through to the Bronze Age. 
  <p>
ETA: I’m excited to “see” everyone again this year and meet those who are joining in for the first time!

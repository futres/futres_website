   <td colspan="2" width="70%">I am a paleobiologist interested in the evolution of terrestrial vertebrate communities, the biogeography and evolution of large mammals, and the impact of humans on ecosystems at the dawn of the anthropocene. I also use functional traits such as body mass and hypsodonty to answer questions about the relationship between environmental change and community turnover. 
  <p>
    
  <p>
I am currently investigating changes in large mammal occurrences in the Indian Subcontinent over the last 4 million years, and look forward to learning about ways to standardize my data, and share ecomorphological data that I have collected over the years.

My research is based in both Africa and North America and my questions primarily focus on mammals and their associated environments. I use multiple proxies to ask paleoecological questions including stable isotopes from bioapatite, collagen, and soil carbonates,  fossil morphology, occurrence, taxonomy, and satellite-based climate and vegetation data. Much of this data is associated with hominin and archeological data.

   <td colspan="2" width="70%">I am a mammalogist and ecologist interested in patterns and drivers of diversity.  I am particularly interested in using functional diversity to investigate the drivers of community assembly, elevational diversity gradients, and biodiversity change. As part of this work I use museum specimens to collect morphological, phenotypic, and life history trait data that offer higher-resolution data on species differences compared to categorical guild assignments, including kidney morphology, hair density, and craniodental morphology. I am interested in learning about tools for applying functional diversity to broad spatial and temporal scales as well as exploring intraspecific variation in key traits across species’ ranges and how it may influence analyses of functional biogeography.

   <td colspan="2" width="70%">I am a paleoecologist interested in understanding the processes that govern mammalian diet and community structure change through time. Some of my work focuses on extant mammals where I use phylogenetic comparative methods to understand mammalian diet evolution, diversity, and how these relate to body mass. For my work on fossil assemblages, I use tooth morphology, and stable isotopic studies, to test hypotheses about the ecological links among extinct taxa and their environment. To better understand how past climate change has influenced structural change, I combine my research to reconstruct food webs for fossil assemblages. I hope that by using the fossil record to explore past ecological structure, my research not only helps expand our paleontological knowledge but also informs how modern communities might respond to current human-influenced climate change and extinction.
  <p>
    
   <p> 
I am excited to talk to others about trait data standardization to allow for reproducibility and collaboration. I have lots of tooth measurements for both modern and extinct mammals from collections around the USA.

A major goal of the repository’s data model and informatic structure is to seamlessly connect scan data to specimen records authored by collection institutions.

In this capacity, I co-developed the low magnification stereomicrowear technique with Nikos Solounias from NYIT —a novel method of examining microscopic scars on dental enamel caused by food substances which employs a standard light stereoscope to examine tooth enamel surfaces.  I have also focused on improving the resolution and repeatability of gross tooth wear methodologies (i.e., mesowear analyses) by co-developing "the mesowear ruler" with Matthew Mihlbachler and Nikos Solounias from NYIT (Old Wesbury, NY USA) and Florent Rivals (Institut Català de Paleoecologia Humana i Evolució Social -IPHES - in Tarragona, Spain). Consequently, most of my data is enamel microwear and mesowear data of living and fossil ungulates and primates.

For the past several years my assistantship has been to oversee the comparative skeletal collection. There are over 11,000 vertebrate (mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and birds) and 1,200 invertebrate specimens (predominantly freshwater mussels from the SE U.S.) accessioned into the collection. Currently, the lab focus is to transition the collection to be available online as there are associated metric data and living histories collected for each specimen which would be valuable across scientific disciplines.

My archaeological research interests include how and why people move across landscapes, what role subsistence plays in site choice, impacts on faunal communities from seasonal and climatic environmental changes, and exploring their resiliency to change. My dissertation research is focused on faunal assemblages from the last ~4,000-2,500 years within the Florida Everglades, a dynamic freshwater wetlands ecosystem.

I’m most interested in integrating trait data for mammal species broadly across global biodiversity databases and museum collections.  I lead an initiative called the Mammal Diversity Database via the American Society of Mammalogists that is updating species-level mammal taxonomy.  We have a new taxonomy and website in development you can view here: <a href="https://mammaldiversity.github.io/">https://mammaldiversity.github.io/</a>
  <p>
    
  <p>
I’d most like to get from the workshop some direction of how best to integrate mammal taxonomy into the rigorous study of trait diversity & diversification globally.

   <td colspan="2" width="70%"> I work at the Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan where I coordinate the Zooarchaeology Laboratory. I am a zooarchaeologist interested in the study of human adaptations in coastal environments through the study of fish remains. My research aims to provide ecological baselines for the identification of healthy tropical fisheries in preindustrial times and to evaluate the anthropogenic affectations on fish population in Yucatan from a long-term perspective. I am excited to learn about new analytical tools and the most effective ways to use species traits to track ecological change.
My datasets include fish remains taxonomic identifications, skeletal measurements and allometric regression for size/weight estimations. Through the workshop I am looking forward to learning more about FuTRES methodologies to share dataset with other colleagues and to networking to effectively apply our data at larger scales.

   <td colspan="2" width="70%">I would say I am a classically trained mammalogist. I’m currently an assistant professor at Chicago State University and a research associate at The Field Museum. I began with application of linear morphometrics on mammals for various type of taxonomic and systematic needs for biodiversity analyses. I then grew to enjoy the application of multivariate approaches to address questions dealing with ontogenetic variation, species delimitations, and correlating morphology with environmental variables. In my lab we have been working with traditional linear morphometrics and 2D geometric morphometrics. I began working on Matlab and then made a transition to R and love learning new applications and potentially developing new approaches to morphology as it applies to taxonomy, functional ecology and diversity, biogeography, population variation, and evolutionary biology. I would love to learn more about 3D geometric morphometrics and techniques for modularity type questions. I would be very interested in learning about any newer multivariate approaches and big data management. I am looking forward to a collaborative atmosphere with like-minded people.

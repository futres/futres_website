I am a paleobiologist interested in the evolution of terrestrial vertebrate communities, the biogeography and evolution of large mammals, and the impact of humans on ecosystems at the dawn of the anthropocene. I also use functional traits such as body mass and hypsodonty to answer questions about the relationship between environmental change and community turnover. 
  <p>
I am currently investigating changes in large mammal occurrences in the Indian Subcontinent over the last 4 million years, and look forward to learning about ways to standardize my data, and share ecomorphological data that I have collected over the years.

I am a third year PhD student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  I am a paleoecologist interested in the evolutionary history of mammal communities and the way they assemble through time.  My research aims to disentangle biotic and abiotic factors that significantly impact community structure prior to and during the presence of hominids using a macroecological approach.  Currently, I am looking at the functional diversity of Cenozoic mammal communities in North America.
  <p>
I am excited to learn about new analytical tools and the most effective ways to use species traits to track ecological change.

I am a paleoecologist focused on how ecological change has affected the course of human evolution as well as how humans have affected their environments. My research is based in both Africa and North America and my questions primarily focus on mammals and their associated environments. I use multiple proxies to ask paleoecological questions including stable isotopes from bioapatite, collagen, and soil carbonates,  fossil morphology, occurrence, taxonomy, and satellite-based climate and vegetation data. Much of this data is associated with hominin and archeological data.

I’m a PhD candidate in the Department of Anthropology at UF. Archaeology and natural history museum collections are invaluable to my research, which draws on human behavioral ecology, biodiversity studies, and zooarchaeological analysis to examine how people in the Caribbean interacted with animals and their environments during pre-Contact periods.
  <p>
During my studies I’ve learned that zooarchaeologists are important contributors to trait-based datasets! Some of my relevant work includes describing extinct rodent species known only from Grenadian archaeological contexts and working with collaborators to investigate how past ritual activities impacted the biogeography of Caribbean rock iguana by comparing biomarkers of specimens from archaeological and neontological collections. 
  <p>
I’m looking forward to learning how FuTRES can help increase access to datasets across disciplines for more informed and collaborative research.

I am a mammalogist and ecologist interested in patterns and drivers of diversity.  I am particularly interested in using functional diversity to investigate the drivers of community assembly, elevational diversity gradients, and biodiversity change. As part of this work I use museum specimens to collect morphological, phenotypic, and life history trait data that offer higher-resolution data on species differences compared to categorical guild assignments, including kidney morphology, hair density, and craniodental morphology. I am interested in learning about tools for applying functional diversity to broad spatial and temporal scales as well as exploring intraspecific variation in key traits across species’ ranges and how it may influence analyses of functional biogeography.

I am an integrative biologist interested in landscape- to continental-scale patterns of mammalian evolution and responses of mammals to past and present environmental change. I use empirical (molecular, phenotypic, trait-based) datasets as well as informatics tools to understand the ecological and environmental contexts in which mammalian phenotypes, life histories, and ecological traits evolve. 
  <p>
Most of my trait datasets are taxon-centric (North American rodents) and consist of morphological or reproductive metrics. Some of these maximize shape resolution (3D GM of skeletal + genital elements) while other maximize spatiotemporal coverage (body lengths/masses in small mammals).

I am a paleoecologist interested in understanding the processes that govern mammalian diet and community structure change through time. Some of my work focuses on extant mammals where I use phylogenetic comparative methods to understand mammalian diet evolution, diversity, and how these relate to body mass. For my work on fossil assemblages, I use tooth morphology, and stable isotopic studies, to test hypotheses about the ecological links among extinct taxa and their environment. To better understand how past climate change has influenced structural change, I combine my research to reconstruct food webs for fossil assemblages. I hope that by using the fossil record to explore past ecological structure, my research not only helps expand our paleontological knowledge but also informs how modern communities might respond to current human-influenced climate change and extinction.
  <p>
I am excited to talk to others about trait data standardization to allow for reproducibility and collaboration. I have lots of tooth measurements for both modern and extinct mammals from collections around the USA.

I am a paleoecologist and focus on using dental tooth wear as a mechanism for assessing dietary traits in herbivorous ungulates and other mammals in order to study global trends in vegetation and climate and extinction patterns through significant climatic events and over vast periods of time. In this capacity, I co-developed the low magnification stereomicrowear technique with Nikos Solounias from NYIT —a novel method of examining microscopic scars on dental enamel caused by food substances which employs a standard light stereoscope to examine tooth enamel surfaces.  I have also focused on improving the resolution and repeatability of gross tooth wear methodologies (i.e., mesowear analyses) by co-developing "the mesowear ruler" with Matthew Mihlbachler and Nikos Solounias from NYIT (Old Wesbury, NY USA) and Florent Rivals (Institut Català de Paleoecologia Humana i Evolució Social -IPHES - in Tarragona, Spain). Consequently, most of my data is enamel microwear and mesowear data of living and fossil ungulates and primates.

I am a doctoral student in the Department of Anthropology focusing on zooarchaeology. For the past several years my assistantship has been to oversee the comparative skeletal collection. There are over 11,000 vertebrate (mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and birds) and 1,200 invertebrate specimens (predominantly freshwater mussels from the SE U.S.) accessioned into the collection. Currently, the lab focus is to transition the collection to be available online as there are associated metric data and living histories collected for each specimen which would be valuable across scientific disciplines. 
  <p>
My archaeological research interests include how and why people move across landscapes, what role subsistence plays in site choice, impacts on faunal communities from seasonal and climatic environmental changes, and exploring their resiliency to change. My dissertation research is focused on faunal assemblages from the last ~4,000-2,500 years within the Florida Everglades, a dynamic freshwater wetlands ecosystem.

Come to me if you suffer from Degenerative Darwin Core Syndrome, Georeferencing Withdrawal, Biodiversity Data Publication OCD, etc. I can provide references if necessary, such as:

I study the evolution and ecology of mammals using the fossil record. Much of my work is on rodents, particularly pocket gophers and their relatives, but I also study whole assemblages. I use morphological data (especially craniodental morphology) to reconstruct the evolution of ecology on trees. I also use quantitative analyses of abundance data to explore the response of small mammals to immigrations and changes in climate or environment.

  <p>
I am interested in the discussion of databases of trait data at the specimen level and the species level. I am currently working on assembling several body size databases including a 20,000 specimen database of geomyoid body masses.

I am an incoming PhD student in the Guralnick Lab. My background is in the systematics and biogeography of Neogene shrews where I primarily focused on the Late Miocene. Since moving to Florida, I have begun work on a systematic review of Florida Soricidae, including some of the earliest members of the family. Currently, my primary work is using the National Ecological Observatory Network data to parse out evolutionary drivers of plant communities, focusing mainly on the nitrogen-fixing clade. 
  <p>
I am excited to learn new techniques through FuTRES that will allow me to combine my interests in fossil/modern and mammal/plant communities to better understand their complex relationships throughout the Neogene.

My research focuses on the palaeobiology, systematics, biogeography and morphology of vertebrates, especially from South America. I study the macroevolutionary changes of these lineages in relation to palaeoenvironmental conditions and geographic distributions, combining palaeontological and neontological data.
  <p>
I regularly collect trait data (mainly measurements of skull and teeth of mammals) for my research and I am interested to learn about the best practices to share these data related with past and incoming publications.

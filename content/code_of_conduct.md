Purpose: to ensure that we all agree to behave like reasonable, respectful adults. Most of us already do, but it is good to have our intentions explicit and state the standards by which we strive to uphold. Many disciplines of science are changing how they look, and with that comes the unearthing of implicit biases and microagressions. We want to ensure that we and those involved uphold a goal to be inclusive of all persons in our field.


### Code of Conduct ###


All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at the FuTRES workshop are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe, inclusive, and collaborative environment for everybody.

Bullying or harassment by any individual will not be tolerated and may result in the individual being removed from the Workshop.

Bullying and harassment includes, but is not limited to: offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, or technology choices; the use of sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate and unwelcomed physical contact and sexual attention; or spitballs of any kind.

Workshop staff are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. No one should use sexualised, racist, or derogatory images, activities, or other material that conflicts with the code of conduct. 

Participants who are asked to stop any bullying or harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the workshop organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the workshop.

If you are being bullied or harassed, or notice that someone else is being bullied harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the workshop staff immediately. Workshop staff will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing bullying or harassment to feel safe for the duration of the workshop. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events. Staff will abide by these rules, as well as assist and ensure compliance.

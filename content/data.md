FuTRES will deliver all processed trait data via an application programming interface (API), web interface, and R package by Summer of 2019.  Currently, code and configuration files for our data processing pipeline can be found at [fovt-data-pipeline](https://github.com/futres/fovt-data-pipeline), which contains all of the settings for processing incoming datasets and aligning with the [FuTRES ontology for vertebrate traits](https://github.com/futres/fovt).

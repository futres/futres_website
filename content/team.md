The Functional Trait Resource for Environmental Studies (FuTRES) project is a collaborative project among four universities (University of Oregon, University of Arizona, University of Florida, and Howard University). The key deliverables of FuTRES are a workflow for assembling functional trait data measured at the specimen level, a database to serve that data, and scientific publications demonstrating the utility of the assembled data.

Kitty Emery is an environmental archaeologist specializing in zooarchaeology (the study of old animal bits and pieces from archaeological sites), and curator of the <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/envarch/">Environmental Archaeology Program</a> at the <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/">Florida Museum of Natural History</a>. She is passionate about adding zooarchaeological data to biodiversity data networks to trace the history of human-animal interactions. She's fairly clueless about informatics, ontologies, Slack and GitHub, but is excited to be learning from the FuTRES team!

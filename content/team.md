<p><figure><img src="/media/kitty150.jpg"/><figcaption>Kitty Emery</figcaption></figure>
Kitty Emery is an environmental archaeologist specializing in zooarchaeology (the study of old animal bits and pieces from archaeological sites), and curator of the [Environmental Archaeology Program](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/envarch/) at the [Florida Museum of Natural History](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/). She is passionate about adding zooarchaeological data to biodiversity data networks to trace the history of human-animal interactions. She's fairly clueless about informatics, ontologies, Slack and GitHub, but is excited to be learning from the FuTRES team!

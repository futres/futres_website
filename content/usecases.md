FuTRES is designed to be expandable, and we expect many novel uses for trait data to come from its implementation. We present here a set of example use cases that we will pursue, using the results both to inform process-based research and to publicize the presence and utility of FuTRES. These use cases focus on mammal data, because we have chosen to focus on this lineage for our initial data ingestion. 

FuTRES will not be limited to mammal data, however, and we will welcome data from domain scientists across the tree of life. In the end, many other analyses are also possible, such as the examination of processes that control miniaturization and gigantism across vertebrates, testing whether deforestation has led to evolutionary changes in bird or insect wing-aspect ratio, determining whether pre- and early historic fishing significantly reduced trophic levels and disturbed ocean ecologies, and testing hypotheses about the limits of allometric scaling in relation to overall body size across lineages of vertebrates, as a few examples.

<b>Bergmann’s Rule</b>: Bergmann's rule is a widely accepted biogeographic rule that individuals within a species are smaller in warmer environments (Bergmann 1847). It provides a predictive framework for understanding potential response of species in the face of climatic changes.  Co-PI Guralnick is investigating whether niche characteristics of species are predictive of relationship between abiotic factors and intraspecific body variation. To best do this, it is critical to aggregate specimen measurements from fossil and modern species and handle direct and inferred measurements of body size. Guralnick will develop use cases focusing on body size variation in small mammals with exemplary sampling in the modern and fossil record (e.g. deer mice) and develop new model frameworks for integrating fossil and modern body size datasets.

<b>Equid Locomotion</b>: The primary activity overseen by Co-PI Bernor will be the ingestion and analysis of his data on equid distal limb elements. These data have been used to characterize the relationship between varying proportions of distal limb elements and locomotion and habitat (Bernor and Harris 2003; Bernor and Kaiser 2006; Bernor et al. 1997, 2003, 2005, 2012, 2013; Bernor and Scott 2003; Kaiser and Bernor 2006; Scott et al. 2005; Gilbert and Bernor 2008; Bernor and White 2009; Wolf et al. 2013). While previous research has revealed a great diversity of size and limb proportions in extinct horses, the ingestion into FuTRES offers a unique opportunity to compare these ‘wild’ pre-human-impact data to the distribution of limb proportions in modern equids of North America. Co-PIs Davis and Emery will work to ingest equid limb proportion data from the archaeological record of the USA. In this way, we can test the hypothesis that existing feral horses have adopted ecological roles analogous to the wild horses that were lost in the megafaunal extinction ~13,000 years ago.

<b>Hypsodonty and Crown Type</b>: Mammalian tooth crown height, or hypsodonty, and occlusal cutting-edge count has proven important for mapping continental-scale precipitation, temperature, and primary productivity patterns in the Neogene of Eurasia (Fortelius et al. 2002; Eronen et al. 2010a,b; Liey et al. 2012). These methods have recently been expanded as Functional Crown Types (FCT) in the Turkana Basin, Kenya by Fortelius et al. (2016). FCT is designed to capture functional durability, structural strength, and cutting power. These factors relate to the environment through available foods, with harder, dustier, and less nutritious foods found in arid environments. Bernor will oversee the ingestion of FCT variables into FuTRES. Once these data are ingested, they can be cross-referenced with body size and limb proportion data to begin testing the hypothesis that these traits are linked as lineages of ungulate mammals have adapted to changing environments.

<b>Using Prey Body Size Data to Track Human Impact</b>:  As a use-case of the FuTRES project, we propose to mobilize key mammalian data hidden in the zooarchaeological archives of the Environmental Archaeology Program of the FLMNH, which contain large quantities of animal trait data associated with 10,000 years of animal use by the ancient peoples of the SE USA. These data can be combined with other modern and paleontological data being ingested into FuTRES and be used to answer questions about human-animal interactions during periods of climate/landscape and culture change. Previous studies have provided proxy data that are of interest to anthropologists who seek to understand human relationships with the environment during periods of cultural change (e.g. Emery 2007; Jones 2016), to those studying long-term ecological and biodiversity trends (e.g. Broughton et al. 2008; Byers and Smith 2007; Wolverton 2005, 2012), and particularly to conservation biologists who must gauge the relative impact of human and other factors on animal population resilience (Frazier 2007; Lyman 2006; Peacock et al 2012; Smith 2005). However, these are generally spatially isolated to one or a few archaeological sites, and are not integrated with the broader time-depth offered by paleontological and modern data. This proposal provides the means to mobilize and integrate paleo-, archaeo-, and neo-ontological data to conduct meaningful, deep-time research on the full range of animal body-size distributions to better inform document body mass changes in primary prey populations.

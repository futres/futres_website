FuTRES is designed to be expandable, and we expect many novel uses for trait data to come from its implementation. We present here a set of example use cases that we will pursue, using the results both to inform process-based research and to publicize the presence and utility of FuTRES. These use cases focus on mammal data, because we have chosen to focus on this lineage for our initial data ingestion. FuTRES will not be limited to mammal data, however, and we will welcome data from domain scientists across the tree of life. In the end, many other analyses are also possible, such as the examination of processes that control miniaturization and gigantism across vertebrates, testing whether deforestation has led to evolutionary changes in bird or insect wing-aspect ratio, determining whether pre- and early historic fishing significantly reduced trophic levels and disturbed ocean ecologies, and testing hypotheses about the limits of allometric scaling in relation to overall body size across lineages of vertebrates.

<b>Bergmann’s Rule</b>: Bergmann's rule is a widely accepted biogeographic rule that individuals within a species are smaller in warmer environments (Bergmann, 1847).  It also provides a predictive framework for understanding potential response of species in the face of climatic changes. However, recent work by Reimer et al. (In Submission) used trait data associated with specimen records from VertNet to show that Bergmann's rule is not generally valid.  This data-intensive approach to examine presumed "rules" using consistent methodologies opens up new avenues of research. Co-PI Guralnick is following up this work and investigating whether niche characteristics of species are predictive of relationship between abiotic factors and intraspecific body variation.  Critical next steps are to determine whether these documented spatial patterns also apply when looking at temporal variation in body size, and, ultimately, building spatiotemporal models of body size.  To best do this, it is critical to aggregate specimen measurements from fossil and modern species and handle direct and inferred measurements of body size. Guralnick will develop use cases focusing on body size variation in small mammals with exemplary sampling in the modern and fossil record (e.g. deer mice) and develop new model frameworks for integrating fossil and modern body size datasets.

<b>Equid Locomotion</b>: The primary activity overseen by Co-PI Bernor will be the ingestion and analysis of his data on equid distal limb elements. These data have been used to characterize the relationship between varying proportions of distal limb elements and locomotion and habitat (Bernor and Harris, 2003; Bernor and Kaiser, 2006; Bernor et al., 1997, 2003, 2005, 2012, 2013; Bernor and Scott, 2003; Kaiser and Bernor, 2006; Scott et al., 2005; Gilbert and Bernor, 2008; Bernor and White, 2009; Wolf et al., 2013). While previous research has revealed a great diversity of size and limb proportions in extinct horses, the ingestion into FuTRES offers a unique opportunity to compare these ‘wild’ pre-human-impact data to the distribution of limb proportions in modern equids of North America. Co-PIs Davis and Emery will work to ingest equid limb proportion data from the archaeological record of the USA, documenting wild horses from before North American extirpation and after European reintroduction. In this way, we can test the hypothesis that existing feral horses have adopted ecological roles analogous to the wild horses that were lost in the megafaunal extinction ~13,000 years ago.

<b>Hypsodonty and Crown Type</b>: Mammalian tooth crown height, or hypsodonty, has proven important for mapping continental-scale precipitation patterns in the Neogene of Eurasia (Fortelius et al. 2002, Eronen et al. 2010a,b). Combining hypsodonty with another ecometric, occlusal cutting-edge count, improved predictions of global rainfall and allowed prediction of temperature and primary productivity (Liu et al., 2012). These methods have recently been expanded as Functional Crown Types (FCT) in the Turkana Basin, Kenya by Fortelius et al. (2016). FCT is designed to capture functional durability, structural strength, and cutting power. These factors relate to the environment through available foods, with harder, dustier, and less nutritious foods found in arid environments. Bernor will oversee the ingestion of FCT variables into FuTRES with ample data currently available in the NOW[RW2]  database for Eurasia and Africa. Once these data are ingested, they can be cross-referenced with body size and limb proportion data to begin testing the hypothesis that these traits are linked as lineages of ungulate mammals have adapted to changing environments.

<b>Using Prey Body Size Data to Track Human Impact</b>:  Hidden in the zooarchaeological archives of the Environmental Archaeology Program of the FLMNH are large quantities of animal trait data, primarily body size metrics, associated with 10,000 years of animal use by the ancient peoples of the SE USA. These data are part of zooarchaeological datasets describing taxonomy, sex/age, and taphonomic characters of skeletal elements recovered from archaeological sites over the past 50 years of excavation in the region. As a use-case of the FuTRES project, we propose to mobilize key mammalian data into VertNet, especially cervid, lagomorph and sciurid data that are well represented in collections.  This mobilization will be done to capture the temporal and contextual data that is vital to their interpretation.  These data can be combined with the paleontological and neontological distribution and attribute data available for the same mammalian fauna from data providers such as VertNet and other paleontological resources such as Neotoma (https://www.neotomadb.org/). Together, these temporally rich datasets will be used to document body mass changes in primary prey populations to answer questions about human-animal interactions during periods of climate/landscape and culture change (changes in human population density and social complexity recorded in other aspects of the archaeological record). Zooarchaeology has long relied on the models of optimal foraging ecology (OFT) and more recently niche construction theory (NCT) from behavioral ecology to track changing foraging efficiency and resource depression, to document the synergies of niche modifications, and to predict past sustainability and resilience (for excellent reviews and discussions, see Lupo 2007; Zeder 2012, 2015; Codding and Bird 2015). These studies provide otherwise missing proxies for the impact of humans on late Pleistocene and early Holocene fauna and their environments through both predation and niche construction (for example Broughton et al. 2010 and Campbell and Butler 2010 in the US; Emery 2008 in Central America; and Nagaoka 2005 in New Zealand to list just a few). Such proxy data are of interest to anthropologists who seek to understand human relationships with the environment during periods of cultural change (e.g. Emery 2007; Jones 2016), to those studying long-term ecological and biodiversity trends (e.g. Broughton et al. 2008; Byers and Smith 2007; Wolverton 2005, 2012) , and particularly to conservation biologists who must gauge the relative impact of human and other factors on animal population resilience (Frazier 2007; Lyman 2006; Peacock et al 2012; Smith 2005). However, these data, and particularly the attribute data such as body size that are pivotal to understanding the human-prey interactions of the anthropocene (Lyman 2004; Wolverton 2008), are generally spatially isolated to one or a few archaeological sites, and are not integrated with the broader time-depth offered by paleontological and modern data. This proposal provides the means to mobilize and integrate paleo, archaeo, and neo data, and to conduct meaningful, deep-time research on the full range of animal body-size distributions to better inform our understanding of relationships between animals, environments, climate, and people.

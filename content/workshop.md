# FuTRES Workshop
The first workshop for FuTRES will be held at the University of Oregon, on July 15-17, 2019.

FuTRES workshops are an opportunity for members of the research community to both learn about the capabilities of the database and shape the development of the structure and tools of FuTRES.


## Scheduled workshops
1. July 15-17, 2019: Established researchers guide database development
2. Summer 2020: Established researchers critique database development
3. Summer 2021: Early-career researchers evaluate database utility

## Agenda for July 15-17, 2019, Workshop
<b>July 15</b></br>
9AM: Lightning talks about use cases for a vertebrate trait database</br>
10AM: Introduction to ontologies</br>
11AM: Data sources already in place</br>
Noon: Lunch and discussion</br>
1PM: Breakout groups by discipline to focus on developing use cases and datasets to target for FuTRES year 2</br>
3PM: Regroup and read out</br>
4PM: Group discussion of potential future research grants that could leverage FuTRES</br>

<b>July 16</b></br>
The second day will be spent in creating trait definition mappings in 3-4 small groups, to create the ontological linkages needed for the use cases defined on Day 1. 

<b>July 17</b></br>
Return together to discuss insights from trait mappings. 
Mix the groups from Day 2 to get synthetic insights and develop new research plans.

<b>Outcomes from July 15-17, 2019 Workshop:</b></br>
- Meeting report published through PenSoft</br>
- Best practices paper for publishing vertebrate trait data</br>
- Research grant proposals to leverage tools from FuTRES</br>
- New datasets added to FuTRES</br>
- Coordination with other ongoing bioinformatics efforts

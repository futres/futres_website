<h3>Proposals</h3>

<h4><b>An ecometric exploration of bovid horn core size in modern Africa</b></h4>
<i>Project Leader: <a href="mailto:avillase@uark.edu"> Amelia Villaseñor</a></i>

<br>

    Ecometrics rely on the principle that morphological traits reflect a species’
interaction with its surroundings, both biotic and abiotic (Eronen et al., 2010a). For example,
traits such as tooth height and hypsodonty reflect variation in climate in both the past and present
(e.g. Eronen et al., 2010b; Fortelius et al., 2002). The development of ecometrics is facilitated by
using traits that are ubiquitous in both the modern and fossil record. Horn cores are both durable
and abundant in the fossil record and modern museum collections, yet they have not been utilized
as an ecometric trait.
  <p>
    We propose to analyze horn core size within the family Bovidae as a proxy for climatic
variability in both the past and present. Within lineages of bovids, horns are used a weapon to
facilitate mating and are strongly affected by sexual selection (Bro-Jørgenson, 2007). As a result,
we hypothesize that climates with higher seasonality and more competition for resources will be
correlated with larger horn size within lineages where males use horns as weapons. However,
abiotic factors may affect tropical lineages differently than those in temperate ecosystems since
horns have been found to have thermoregulatory functions by releasing heat (Picard et al., 1996).
Limited pilot data support the hypothesis stated above. Data from paleontological
collections in Hadar Ethiopia, identified a trend toward larger horn core size in the extinct impala,
Aepyceros sp. nov. between 3.42Ma and ~3.0Ma. There is also a trend toward larger tooth size in
Australopithecus afarensis male specimens within the same period. Both lineages show the most
dramatic size increases in the youngest sediments (3.0Ma), which were reconstructed as being the
most arid and seasonal of the formation.
    <p>
    As intern at the Smithsonian (in 2009), I followed up on this trend and tested the
hypothesis that among modern Aepyceros melampus (impala) horn size would be larger in
specimens from geographic regions with high aridity. The Aepyceros melampus range spans
across sub-Saharan Africa. Using numerous specimens from the Smithsonian, I found that basal
horn size (APxML), length, and horn shape were significantly correlated with all rainfall
variables (e.g. fig. 1). However, the strongest pattern was that the eastern African impala had
larger basal horn size, while southern Africa impala had smaller horns. Seasonality as measured
by the CV of yearly rainfall correlated most strongly with basal horn size (fig. 2). Molar row size,
the geometric mean of cranial variables for males and females (proxies for body size), were not
correlated with any rainfall variables using bivariate plots and linear correlation.
<p>
Relationship to the FuTRES mission: The scope of this paper will explore the potential of using
horn core size as an ecometric trait using more sophisticated climate data and methods. We will
also comment on the relationship between sexual dimorphism and climate by expanding the study
to measure horn size and cranial or post cranial traits (as proxies for body size) in other
geographically widespread bovid species (beyond impala) where both males and females have
horns. Some of the data described here have already been contributed to the FuTRES database but
additional trait data will also be included. I have collected more data from the horn cores from
other bovid species (beyond Aepyceros melampus). If the Smithsonian Museum Support Center
opens again soon, I plan to measure more specimens and species. Since the question of the project
explores population level skeletal traits, specimen level data is imperative. This project is a prime
example of the type of ecological questions that will be facilitated by the FuTRES mission.
<p>
Project workflow and completion: The scope of the project is open to discussion. Since it was
conceived when I was an undergraduate, I’d be open to ideas about how to broaden the scope,
refine the hypothesis, or perhaps expand the project into multiple papers. See the proposed
workflow below.

<h4><b>Approximating mammal functional trait diversity using body mass</b></h4>
<i>Project Leader: <a href="mailto:DFraser@nature.ca">Danielle Fraser</a></i>

<br>

    Quantifying biodiversity (i.e., the numbers and types of organisms) enables us to understand the geographic distributions of species, drivers of those distributions, to identify conservation “hot spots,” and, ultimately, to assess community, population, and geographic change resulting from both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic processes (1). Measuring biodiversity in the past, in particular, allows us to assess the roles of a variety of long-term drivers (e.g., tectonics, climate change) (2) and develop a baseline understanding of how assemblages of species respond to global and regional changes (3, 4). 
<p>
    There are a variety of ways to measure biodiversity, the simplest of which is richness (i.e., the number of species in an assemblage). The various metrics for Functional Diversity (FD) attempt to describe the array of lifestyles occupied by species in the same assemblage (5). They all rely on measuring or scoring ecologically relevant traits to quantify how species in the same assemblage are distributed in niche or trait space (6). FD has advantages over richness in that it can be used to identify assemblages of species or particular species with unique characteristics and thus to inform species-agnostic conservation targets (7, 8).
  <p>
    Palaeontologists and mammalogists have developed a variety of metrics for approximating the niche of mammal species, including the calcaneal gear ratio and various craniodental measurements, all of which are intended to capture some aspect of the mammalian niche (e.g., locomotion, diet) (9-13). The process of fossilization, however, means that palaeontologists are often faced with fragmentary fossils (14). Much of the taxonomically informative fossil record is comprised of isolated teeth or mandibulae and maxillae with multiple teeth; other isolated elements (e.g., calcanea) may not be reliably identifiable to species. Thus, many of the niche proxies, such as locomotion derived from post-cranial elements, that are available for modern mammals are unavailable for large numbers of fossil and extinct species. 
<p>
    Fortunately, body mass is a fundamental mammalian trait that is correlated with many other components of the lifestyle, including diet and locomotion (15, 16). Body mass is also easily estimated from both dental and post-cranial remains (often with R2 values ≥ 0.9). The goal of the proposed study is therefore to understand whether body mass alone can be used to quantify mammalian functional diversity. 
<p>
Methods. Using trait data in the FuTRES database (e.g., body mass, post-cranial elements to determine locomotor type, and occurrences to gather habitat data in combination with GIS-based ecotype and climate data) and species-level traits (diet) for species in the Western Hemisphere, we will compare spatial patterns of FD estimates (17) calculated using body mass alone and using suites of other traits (18). We will make the explicit assumption that space can be substituted for time and that the results apply equally to the fossil record of mammals (19). We will test whether different suites of functional traits identify the same “hot spots'' and test for correlations among patterns of FD using a method such as Kendall’s Tao. Finally, if differences in the apparent spatial patterns of FD are found, we will identify which traits may be driving them. D. Fraser and colleagues (2019), showed qualitatively that FD calculated based on body mass alone identifies similar areas of high and low FD in the Western Hemisphere as estimates incorporating other traits (Fig. 1). If these findings are borne out by a larger, more thorough analysis, mammal palaeontologists may confidently estimate FD using body mass alone, aligning palaeoecology and neoecology.
<p>
Engagement. The FuTRES datastore includes data for many North American mammal species, particularly in the USA. Furthermore, the database includes individual-scale data, which will enable us to derive new species means (e.g. for body mass) that are tied directly to specimens in museum collections. The project will also benefit greatly from the expertise of participants in the FuTRES workshops.

<h4><b>Inter- and intra- trait variation</b></h4>
<i>Project Leader: <a href="mailto:b_mclean@uncg.edu">Bryan McLean</a></i>

<br>

    The <b>Inter/Intra</b> project takes a quantitative approach to exploring how individual-level
(and, especially, specimen-level) trait data inform our understanding of biological processes and
progress the precision of comparative evolutionary and ecological analyses. Overarching aims of Inter/Intra are to <b>a)</b> explore existing theoretical framework(s) that underpin use of individual-
level trait data in evolution and ecology; <b>b)</b> conduct focused trait-based analyses and quantify how individual-level trait data affect inferences; and <b>c)</b> identify areas where methodological
advances by the community are necessary to accommodate such analyses in the future. The
project builds on meaningful conversations at previous FuTRES workshops and will create a
space for the team to fully explore these ideas in a data-driven way.
<p>
    The Inter/Intra project is open to any researcher (PIs, postdocs, and graduate students)
interested in the topics above, and so far, we have identified a small but diverse group of
interested trait-based researchers committed to participating. Our group will spend the first
FuTRES workshop identifying major uses of trait-based research in modern ecology and
evolution; these discussions will guide the types of quantitative analyses we target for project
goals. We envision targets will include, but not be limited to analysis of phylogenetic signal in
single traits; inferring models of trait evolution on phylogenies or from time series (e.g. for
paleo) data; and understanding how traits inform understanding of assembly in past or present
mammal communities. In particular, we hope to build on the recent work of Balk et al. ("A
solution to the challenges of interdisciplinary aggregation and use of specimen-level trait data",
in press), to improve our understanding of process inferences from individual-level trait data
sets.
<p>
    The project will proceed by self-dividing our group into teams by analysis type. Within
each team, we will strive to include researchers with data familiarity, functional (i.e., coding)
expertise, and data visualization expertise. Our goal will be to utilize specimen-level data
currently contained in the FuTRES data store; however, additional data that could be readily
included in FuTRES, or data which is suitable for eventual inclusion in the store (e.g., pending
extension of the trait ontology), will also be considered. For user-provided datasets suitable for
FuTRES, we will work with researchers to achieve this prior to project publication. We
anticipate that use cases will center primarily on morphological and life history traits of
mammals, providing the opportunity to maximally explore ideas discussed at prior FuTRES
workshops and currently available trait data.
<p>
    Teams will be expected to meet routinely between FuTRES workshops to coordinate
workload and conduct analyses (with McLean attending all meetings); our goal in subsequent
FuTRES workshops will be reporting on analyses to other participants and FuTRES organizers for
feedback. To ensure consistency and encourage repeatability across teams, all projects will be housed on a dedicated GitHub repository where code will be actively developed and stored,
with links to the original datasets contained in FuTRES.
<p>
    The life sciences are currently experiencing a major increase in trait-based research and
development of different trait databases, with many of the latter existing at the species (or
higher) levels and having variable taxonomic completeness. However, individual-level trait data
provide a way to understand trait variation and link that variation to explicit ecological and
environmental contexts. The Inter/Intra project seeks to demonstrate quantitatively how
individual-level trait data enhance our insights into biological pattern and process. Progress
towards this goal can be achieved within a relatively short timeline because our group will
include researchers who routinely work with trait data; furthermore, many – but not all – are
paleo- or neomammalogists and this speak a common language. Many participants currently
hold cleaned trait data which will be immediately useful in the work, and they have expertise in
ecological and evolutionary analyses that can be shared among teams and participants. Our
vision is that this project will illuminate ways forward for the broader community in trait-based
research.

<h4><b>New frontiers and perspectives in stydying fossil and extant <i>Equus</i></b></h4>
<i>Project Leader: <a href="mailto:hdebasto@uoregon.edu">Helena Machado</a> and <a href="mailto:omar.cirilli@phd.unipi.it">Omar Cirilli</a></i>

<br>

    Morphologic and morphometric analyses are one of the most powerful tool to investigate the variety of biological processes in living and extinct species, with special remarks also to evaluate the relationships in single or multiple populations. Widespread taxa often present great phenotypic plasticity, with morphological variations related to the biotic and abiotic gradients of the heterogeneous environment present through their geographic extension. However, those ecomorphotypes not always extends to evaluate the species level. Taxonomy and systematics would be greatly benefited by a higher understanding of those morphological variations, specially through an individual trait analysis. Here, we propose the study of extinct and living Equus as a model system for trait biogeography.
<p>
    Despite over a century of work, there is still no complete consensus on Equus taxonomy nor phylogeny among specialists. It is hypothesized that North American Equus can be divided into stilt and stout legged horses, but there is still a need for a better understanding of the groups as most work so far has focused on provincial horse faunas. 
<p>
    Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution special volume “Examining Evolutionary Trends in Equus and its Close Relatives from Five Continents” has combined the most recent and updated works and global overview of the genus Equus, and along with more recent papers it has become clear that there is still need for a more comprehensive understanding of the genus. This project, then, aims to gather Equus specialists from around the globe to discuss the most recent results and future perspectives on Equus’ evolution.
<p>
    Considering the workshop time frame and the goal of having at least some preliminary results by its conclusion, we propose a comparative study of Equus from around the globe to investigate the proportion of the limb bones and how does it change among the species. Recent molecular work revealed signals of bidirectional dispersion between caballine horse populations between North America and Eurasia which brings back the question of the origin of the stout-legged Equus. Understanding the distinction of stilt and stout legged horses is an important step to recognize when did the former become replaced by the latter in North American, Eurasia and Africa, as well as the differences in molecular versus morphologically based reconstructions. It is important, then, to evaluate the variability and biogeography of the limb bones traits.
<p>
    FuTRES has incorporated the Equid Bernor Global Cenozoic database, collected principally by Raymond Louis Bernor and recently by Omar Cirilli, and is on its way to incorporate specimens collected from data mining horse literature. This background should provide enough data to have preliminary results on Equus intra and interspecific variability. Helena Machado will organize new data assembly of New World Equus and Hippidion data to augment data already acquired for her PhD research project on the evolutionary relationships of North, Central and South American Equus.  We invision that she will develop a database in parallel with Bernor’s database which is an objective of the FuTRES 1 NSF funded project.
<p>
    This project will allow us to engage with the FuTRES ecosystems as it will either add more data or analyze pre-existing ones. Moreover, the comparative study on Equus limb bones dialogues directly with Raymond Louis Bernor FuTRES project on Equid Locomotion. 
<p>
    The FuTRES workshop will allow an open and important collaboration among the experts for which we propose the following topics to be covered throughout the workshop sessions:
- Paleobiogeography: to give the opportunity to exchange and develop data leading to increased knowledge of the Equus fossil record in Americas, Eurasia and Africa as well as, hopefully, integrating molecular, extant and fossil data.
- Morphometrics: to discuss the application of analytical and statistical tools for morphometrical analyses. This would provide an important opportunity to discuss the intra and interspecific variability among all the Equus species.
- Phylogeny: to discuss the most recent results on Equus phylogeny, hopefully integrating molecular data with skeletal morphological data.
- Paleoecology: to discuss and present the most recent advances on body size and paleodiet on fossil Equus species. It would be interesting to focus the discussion on how the ecological factors and the environment play a role in the adaptation both on diet and skeleton elements following the results of Saarinen et al. (2021).
<p>
    The overall outcomes expected from this workshop are: 
-  update and extend the 2020 Frontiers Equus volume; 
- database development.
- an application to NSF for a RCN (Research Coordinated Network) following the 1981 AMNH International Hipparion Research Initiative wherein Equid measurements were defined and used by the Equid community (Eisenmann et al., 1988; Bernor et al., 1997).
<p>
    The project will be conducted throughout the workshop time frame, and we propose the following organizational structure for the Project Working Sessions: August 20 – introduction and topics (listed above) discussion; September 17 – topics and project discussion; October 22 and November 19 – analyzing results; and December 10 – reports from the working session.

<h4><b>Linking open data across metric data repositories and discipines</b></h4>
<i>Project Leader: <a href="mailto:ndelsol@ufl.edu">Nicolas Desol</a>, <a href="mailto:lmd@openconetxt.org">Meghan Dennis</a>, <a href="mailto:ciszka@opencontext.org">Paulina Przystupa</a>, <a href="mailto:sarah@opencontext.org">Sarah W. Kansa</a>, and <a href="mailto:kemery@flmnh.ufl.edu">Kitty Emery</a></i>

<br>

    This project aims to document the process of integrating data from Open Context (opencontext.org, an archaeological open data publishing and curating platform) and FuTRES to highlight the feasibility and research value of linked open data. While many archaeologists, paleontologists, and biologists build their own datasets and use them intensively for research, or contribute data to collaborative databases, it remains challenging to use data collected by others or curated in separated repositories. Several other hurdles also face data users. Data sharing has often focused on archiving for compliance purposes, and this has resulted in messy and poorly described data entering repositories. Repositories are often still siloed or linked only at the disciplinary level (such as Open Context for archaeological data, iDigBio for biodiversity data, etc.) or focus on specific data types (such as trait data in the case of FuTRES). For the data user, there are few opportunities to learn about how to discover, evaluate, and integrate data from multiple sources including their own datasets. Focusing on data reuse best practice and the research benefits of data integration will help scholars be more thoughtful about data clean up and documentation. Published examples of how to discover relevant data and prepare it for integration can provide much needed guidance for archaeologists, paleontologists, and neontologists to engage in linked open data. 
<p>
    This project will explore the processes and realities of linking biometrical data already published in Open Context with similar data in FuTRES and in personal datasets. We will focus on the integration of metric skeletal data from archaeological cow specimens (Bos taurus) and any possible existing datasets on modern and ancestral cows (Bos primigenius) from the FuTRES dataset or other interested workshop participants. Open Context has a new Data Literacy Program that has been developing learning modules drawing on archaeological cattle data, including metric data, as an exemplar of how to use open data from Open Context for research purposes. This project is being conducted by Meghan Dennis and Paulina Przystupa (Postdoctoral Researchers with Open Context). At the same time Nicolas Delsol (a Ph.D. student at the University of Florida) has a Colonial New World cow dataset that includes metric data as well. In this project, Delsol will add his cow metric data to FuTRES and then together with Open Context and FuTRES personnel, explore best practice to integrate the Open Context cow metric data to FuTRES data (Delsol’s and others) and/or link Open Context and FuTRES data into a separate research dataset using an API. This entire process will be documented step by step and published in R as well as a research paper so that others can benefit from following a “recipe” for linking data across disciplines and repositories. The attempt to integrate/link datasets across systems will be helpful to document to understand the challenges and potential stumbling blocks in this kind of work. This attempt alone could be a useful research paper. If the data integration/linking works well, then we could proceed to a simple research study of body size differences in Old/New World or pre/post colonialism contexts.     This project would support professional development and mentorship, as it could be run primarily by Open Context’s Data Literacy Program postdoctoral researchers Meghan Dennis and Paulina Przystupa, and Ph.D. student Nicolas Delsol, with mentorship from FuTRES and Open Context, furthering community building among early career researchers. 
<p>
Methods
<p>
    <u>Data</u>. Datasets to be used in this project include (1) open access cattle biometrical data documented on 14,524 specimens from 20 projects published in Open Context; (2) unpublished cattle biometrical data collected by project participant Nicolas Delsol (1,685 linear measurement on 804 bone specimens from four archaeological sites); (3) any existing cattle data available in FuTRES; and (4) any appropriate datasets from other interested participants that could be quickly integrated into FuTRES. 
<p>
    <u>Approach</u>. This project will document the process of integrating data from two different systems and combining data across disciplines. The step-by-step process includes data discovery, download, checking for integrity, clean up, and alignment. We will also document data analysis and visualization using R. 
<p>
    <u>Outcomes and Dissemination</u>. The aim of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility, process, and value of combining datasets from different Web resources. We will document this process in R for others to reuse with their own datasets and we will publish a paper about linked open data, highlighting this case study of linking Open Context and FuTRES data. 
FuTRES engagement
<p>
    A first step of this project will be to upload the Delsol dataset to FuTRES (using the FuTRES Rshiny app) and thereby integrating the Delsol data with any other pre-existing FuTRES or interested workshop participant cow data. This dataset will be integrated with related data published in Open Context. The primary aim of this work is to demonstrate successful integration of related data from FuTRES and Open Context to encourage scholars to develop research programs that draw on linked open data. 

<br>

<h4><b>Testing allometric methods</b></h4>
<i>Project Leader: <a href="mailto:delasancha@gmail.com">Noé de la Sancha</a></i>

<br>

    Allometry has been used in the context of three different phenomena; ontogenetic, static, and in evolutionary allometry (Cock 1966, Cheverud 1982, Klingenberg 1996, Schlichting and Piggliucci 1998). Ontogenetic allometry refers to the growth trajectory of structures as a function of body size during the life of an individual. Static allometry refers to the scaling relationship among individuals between one structure as a function of total body size or between two structures once growth has stopped or at a particular developmental stage (Stern and Emien 1999). Meanwhile, evolutionary (phylogenetic) allometry refers to the size relationship between structures across species (Stern and Emien 1999). While the main application of allometric equations was used on morphology, virtually any feature of an organism (e.g., life history traits) can be compared to size (Stern and Emien 1999) and show simple log-log (power function) allometric scaling laws as a function of size including for example metabolic rates, lifespans, growth rates, heart rates, length and radii of aortas, cerebral gray matter, genome length, densities of mitochondria and metabolic enzymes, population density decreases (West and Brown 2005). 
<p>
    Bivariate approaches to allometry were represented by plotting two metric traits (usually log transformed) against each other (Huxley 1932) or by plotting a metric of shape as a function of size (Gould 1966). Bivariate techniques usually use a simple power law (West and Brown 2005) and these can take different regression approaches for example least-square regression or reduced major axis regression (Giannini et al. 2004). In these approaches significance of variables is indicative of allometry, where measures of slope (b) < 1 represent “negative” allometry and b > 1 represent “positive” allometry, while non-significant relationships represent isometry. Power functions are most commonly used and applied, but are there other functions which might be better predictors across taxa? There might be other functions beyond the power function which best explains the relationships between variables as a function of allometry and that have biological significance. There are a plethora of other potential models which might be useful in explaining these relationships. The literature for species-area relationships to explain species richness is vast with potential, meaningful models (Triantis et al. 2012, Matthews et al. 2016). Traditionally these relationships have also been assumed to be best represented by a power function. Recently, at least 20 different models have been proposed to test these relationships (Table 1). Here, we take advantage of these same models and apply them to allometric relationships of a traditional question in paleontology, biogeography, and ecology: the mass versus length relationship.
<p>
    The aim of this study is to test the universality of the power function as it relates allometries of body size to other valuable life history traits. Thus we will use a dataset from across the mammal tree of life to test the 1) best fit models for body size and total length; 2) the best fit model family; 3) the best fit shape (are there asymptotes); 4) the parameters and implementation of of a power function in cases that it applies. 
<p>
Methods
<p>
    <u>Data</u>. We compiled a dataset across the mammal tree of life to test various functions to test allometries in mammals using the FuTRES datastore. We added a higher taxonomy to the dataset. MAB performed the first round of data cleaning using a simple outlier detection test. Using Noé’s expertise, he removed obvious outliers from the dataset.
<p>
    Majority of these samples come from VertNet (downloaded Aug 2020 with Traiter trait extraction) which were ingested into the FuTRES datastore.
<p>
    <u>Sampling</u>. We currently have a dataset which includes most terrestrial mammals orders. We ran preliminary data for several orders (see Figure 2) which shows the comparison of 20 mass by length functions using the sars R package (Matthews et al. 2019). Comparison via AICc shows that with these datasets the regular power function alone is not the best fit function. 
<p>
    Small mammal datasets did not work at first and this was because small mammal datasets varied considerably in sample sizes per species, (ranging from a few dozens to thousands of specimens for other species), and many species clearly included juveniles to very large adults. These would be valuable to compare these at the species level but are not helpful when comparing between taxa or at the order level. Thus we began by manually curating datasets. We began by visually subsetting the ~ 30% of samples from species specific datasets (see Figure 1). After months of screening species by species by eye, Meghan developed a script to automate the dataset subsetting. We are currently in the process of testing these subsets for small mammals. We would like to run the analyses at multiple taxonomic scales, ranging from all mammals, to orders, to families, and even genera for diverse groups. We can also test this with species that have large datasets ( > 1000 specimens). We recently subsetted rodents and bats. 
<p>
    <u>Analyses</u>. We perform model selection using AICc on 20 models (Table 1). Our aim is to test the universality of mass x length relationships. We feel this is a good review to verify if the power function truly is the best approach for other taxa or datasets. And perhaps each dataset should consider comparison of these models prior to predictive analyses. 
FuTRES engagement
<p>
    This project explicitly uses data available in the FuTRES datastore that is not available anywhere else, and is the largest specimen-level trait datastore. This project will also benefit from the technical and broad knowledge of the FuTRES community.
